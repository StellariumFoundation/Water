 # 🌊 Water AI: The Unified AI Supermodel

> *"You put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle. Be water, my friend."* — **Bruce Lee**

**Water AI** is the intelligent core of the Stellarium ecosystem. Conceived by **John Victor**, it is designed not merely as a chatbot, but as a practical and accessible form of **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**. It serves as a universal force-multiplier for human potential, aggregating the world's best specialized AI capabilities into a single, fluid interface.

## 💎 The Vision: Augmenting Humanity
The current AI revolution is fragmented. Users are forced to navigate a maze of specialized tools. **Water AI** solves this by acting as the **Master Orchestrator**. It understands complex intent, routes tasks to state-of-the-art specialized models, and performs actual digital labor.

It is a **gift to humanity**, designed to empower individuals and industries to achieve the **Elevation to Eden**.

## 🚀 Key Differentiators

*   **Intelligent Orchestration:** A sophisticated Go-based core that triages requests between **Specialized Knowledge** and **Autonomous Action**.
*   **Best-of-Kind Specialization:** Dynamically leverages a curated ecosystem of the world’s leading AI models (Finance, Law, Engineering, Creative Arts).
*   **True Action & Labor:** Beyond text generation. Water AI drafts contracts, generates 3D designs, writes software, and launches campaigns via **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**.
*   **Formless & Persistent:** Runs as a background daemon on your OS, accessible via a minimalist GUI or remote bridges like Telegram.
*   **Privacy-First & Local:** Envisioned to run high-performance actions locally on client devices to ensure data sovereignty.

## 🛠 Getting Started (Alpha)

### Prerequisites
*   [Go 1.24+](https://golang.org/dl/)
*   GCC / Clang (CGO is required for the Fyne GUI)
*   Linux: `libgl1-mesa-dev`, `libxcursor-dev`, `libxrandr-dev`, `libxinerama-dev`, `libxi-dev`, `libxxf86vm-dev`
*   macOS: Xcode Command Line Tools
*   Windows: MinGW-w64

### Installation
1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/StellariumFoundation/Water.git
    cd Water
    ```

2.  **Build & Run**
    ```bash
    make build
    ./bin/water          # Launches the gateway + Fyne GUI
    ./bin/water server   # Headless gateway only
    ./bin/water --version
    ```
    *A single binary starts both the backend gateway (port 7777) and the Fyne desktop GUI.*

3.  **Release builds for all platforms**
    ```bash
    make release         # Outputs to dist/
    ```
